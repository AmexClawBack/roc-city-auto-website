This is where youll be able to see the progress being made on your website in real time. the figma link included is what we will begin first. It is simply a wireframe that we can reference, along with tveauto.com.... The only files you have to concern yourself with here is the readme.md and .replit. ill provide updates in this readme. and the .replit is your live view of the site.

This is the wireframe that we will be using to design our layout. Client liked the styling of https://tveauto.com/ we will be basing our design on that site.
